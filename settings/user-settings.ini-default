;Default Settings for KG6WXC MeshMap
;Feb - 2025
;
;***IMPORTANT***
;This file should not be edited directly, please retain it "as is" for future changes.
;Copy this file to: "user-settings.ini" in this same directory and make your changes there.
;
;This default file is read in first, and your personal settings override these defaults.
;
;You want to make your changes in between the quotes, 
;ie: localnode = "10.x.x.x"
;
;Each section has comments that should explain what they are for.
;-------------------------------------------------------------

;;Your localnode's IP address or hostname
;The system running the Polling script should be able to resolve the host name.
;If it cannot, you'll need to change this to an IP address.
;Just leave it set at "localnode.local.mesh" unless you need to change it.
;--------------------------------------------------------------
localnode = "localnode.local.mesh"

;;SQL Type
;meshmap still uses MariaDB as default.
;SQLite3 support is still planned for the future.
;Options now are: "mysql" only.
SQL_TYPE = "mysql"

;;SQL username, password, database name, table names.
;ONLY NEED TO CHANGE THESE IF YOU ARE USING A MYSQL SERVER
;The SQL server does not have to be on the system that is running the polling script.
;You **must** at least update sql_user, sql_passwd, and sql_server to reflect *your* environment!
;You probably do not want to (and should not) change the sql_db* entries unless you really know what you are doing!
;-------------------------------------------------------------
sql_server = "localhost"
sql_user = "mesh-map"
sql_passwd = "mesh-map_sql_user_password"
sql_db = "node_map"
sql_db_tbl = "node_info"

;;Node expiration intervals
;after how many *days* do nodes get removed when we have not heard from them?
;Set expire_old_nodes to "true" to actually expire the old nodes. "false" will not expire any nodes.
;--------------------------------------------------------------
expire_old_nodes = "true"
node_expire_interval = "30"

;;Current firmware version.
;This will check the internet for the current aredn versions.
;"Offline" manual check coming back soon
;--------------------------------------------------------------
AREDN_VERSION_CHECK_URL = "http://downloads.arednmesh.org/afs/www/config.js"
aredn_firmware_check = "true"
;current_stable_fw_version = "3.22.12"

;;Polling is always run in parallel now.
;a separate php script is spawned for each node on the network,
;this runs much faster timewise.
;it probably doesn't use more resources than doing it sequetially, it just does it all in one big burst.
;Set to how many nodes to poll at once, the script will keep this many going until all are done.
;What happens is that you end up with a handful of timeouts at the end.
;--------------------------------------------------------------
numParallelThreads = "60"

;;Map Center Coordinates and starting zoom level
;These are the coordinates for the center of the map on the webpage, and the initial Zoom Level.
;This will probably take some experimenting to get just right.
;These values are for Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties in California, USA.
;--------------------------------------------------------------
map_center_coordinates['lat'] = "34.35"
map_center_coordinates['lon'] = "-119.6"
map_initial_zoom_level = "10"

;;Prefer Kilometers over Miles?
;change to "true" to flip the preference
;the map page will then show 1km (1.62mi)
kilometers = false

;;Map Tile servers you wish to use
;If you wish to add more, just create a new line in the same fashion.
;ie: mapTileServers['Name of Map'] = "//new.server.name/tiles/blah/blah/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
;They can even be directories that contain map tiles in the correct directory structure.
;if you do use a directory name, it must be relative to the webroot.
;ie: mapTileServers['osm_tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png']
;
;You could add them to your hearts content! Try not to go overboard. :)
;
;Append the string "-default" to the name of the map you'd like to have shown by default
;
;You must include the /{z}/{x}/{y}.png here, but make sure your using the right one
;for the server you are using. "/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" is just an example
;--------------------------------------------------------------
mapTileServers['Topographic'] = "//{s}.tile.opentopomap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
mapTileServers['Street-default'] = "//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
mapTileServers['Satellite'] = "//basemap.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/USGSImageryOnly/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}"

;;*NOTE*
;Any any tile server with ".local.mesh" in it's URL will be used
;when the webpage is accessed from a client that is also on the mesh.
;This behavior is disabled by default, uncomment and update the URL to use
;mapTileServers['KG6WXC on AREDN'] = "//kg6wxc-osm.local.mesh/osm_tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"

;;The Title of the web page, web page logo and the text above the map.
;--------------------------------------------------------------
pageTitle = "KG6WXC MeshMap"
attribution = "KG6WXC MeshMap"
mapContact = ""

;;Local Webpage Data Files Directory
;This is where the polling script will save the java files for the webpage.
;Wherever you copied the webpage files to, there is a "data" directory, use that path.
;*NOTE*
;If the webpage will run on a seperate system and use the "Upload To Cloud" feature (below),
;than this could be any directory that the polling script has write permissions to.
;
;USE A FULL PATH! example: "/var/www/html/meshmap/data"
;---------------------------------------------------------------
webpageDataDir = "/var/www/html/meshmap/data"

;;Used to get the map data out to another system on or off the mesh network.
;;THIS IS AN ADVANCED FEATURE
;;You will either understand how to use or not.
;;I can't explain it all here, there is no room!
;;**NOTE**
;This requires ssh access to the remote system
;AND that you setup an SSH keyfile without a password ON BOTH systems first.
;If none of that made sense just leave it commented!
;---------------------------------------------------------------
;uploadToCloud = false
;cloudSSHKeyFile = "/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa"
;cloudServer['ExampleName'] = "user@host:directory"
;;cloudServer['ExampleName2'] = "user@host:directory"
