# KG6WXC-meshmap

This is the _new_ KG6WXC MeshMap device polling backend.  
It is _very much_ a work in progress, quite rough, and is being actively worked on, but it _does_ actually work.

If you want to run this, the MySQL/MariaDB database will need to be setup before hand.
SQLite is not fully working yet.
Plz contact KG6WXC for help if you wish to help test this.

You will _not_ see a map webpage from this, it is only the part that populates the database and will output some java files for use _with_ the webpage.  

Any help is appreciated!
