# KG6WXC-meshmap

This is the _new_ KG6WXC MeshMap device polling backend.  
It is _very much_ a work in progress, and is being actively worked on, but it _does_ actually work.  
Instructions have not been written yet, setup is very similar to the original meshmap.  
  
You will _not_ see a map webpage from this, it is only the part that populates the database and will output some java files for use _with_ the webpage.  
Webpage code is here:  
https://github.com/r1de/KG6WXC-meshmap-webpage  
  
If you want to run this, the MySQL/MariaDB database will need to be setup before hand.  
SQLite is not fully working yet.  
Plz contact KG6WXC for help if you wish to help test this.  
  
Any help is appreciated!
